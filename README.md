# Event Tracker
A simple pythom app to keep track of important events.

# Description
This app allows a user to enter, edit, or delete event names and dates.  For each event entered into the event log, the total number of days between the event and the current date are calculated.

The app was built with python 3.10.1 and Tkinter.  The GUI style was leveraged from https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme under the MIT License.  The Azure Dark Theme provides a nice modern update over the default Tkinter style.

I've always enjoyed knowing how many days are left until a particular date.  I've written several versions of this python app and each iteration has improved upon the last. I am this particularly pround of this version built with Tkinter and I decided to make it my very first project shared through GitHub.

# How To Use
1. Download the project folder and save it anywhere on your hard drive.
2. Navigate to the project folder in terminal and type
```python
python app_main.py
```
